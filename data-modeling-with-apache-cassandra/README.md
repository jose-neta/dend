## DEND - Project 2

For query 2 I've used the same table `sessions` as I used for query 1. 

I Assumed that for each session ID there is only one user ID and also knowing 
that clustering keys are sorted in ascending order by default I simply needed to 
filter by session ID instead of filtering by session ID and item in session as suggested.
